# Welcome to the map5topo website!

![map5topo](assets/images/map5topo-oosterbeek.jpg){ data-title="Oosterbeek" align=left }

[map5topo](https://map5topo.nl) is a new (2023) topographic digital map covering The Netherlands plus
parts of bordering countries. The map5topo project started in April 2022 and is ongoing since.

Source data originates from Open Datasets like the Dutch "Key Registries" ("Basisregistraties": BAG, BRT, BGT, BRK, AHN, ...) 
and from OpenStreetMap.
               
map5topo is provided by [map5.nl](https:///map5.nl)
via OGC tiled web services like WMTS, but also "XYZ" (Google/OSM tiles, a.k.a. Web Mercator) tiles. Currently only raster (image) tiles.

This website now covers mainly work-in-progress documentation. Eventually map5topo will be an Open Source project.
At the moment we are cleaning up code and more, as to have a more accessible project. Be patient!

Please see the left hand navigation for the table of contents.
