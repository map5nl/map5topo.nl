# Welcome to the map5topo website!

![map5topo](assets/images/map5topo-oosterbeek.jpg){ align=left }

[map5topo](https://map5topo.nl) is a new (2023) topographic digital map covering The Netherlands plus
part of bordering countries. Source data comes from Open Datasets like the Dutch "Key Registries" ("Basisregistraties": BAG, BRT, BGT, BRK, AHN, ...) 
and from OpenStreetMap.
               
map5topo is provided by [map5.nl](https:///map5.nl)
via OGC tiled web services like WMTS, but also "XYZ" (Google/OSM tiles, a.k.a. Web Mercator) tiles. Currently only raster (image) tiles.

This website now covers mainly work-in-progress documentation. Eventually map5topo will be an Open Source project.
At the moment we are cleaning up code and more, as to have a more accessible project. Be patient!

Please see the left hand navigation for the table of contents.
